Brave the elements in style, even the vacuum of space!
This mod adds a series of jumpsuits made from hypermesh: hyperweave treated to enhance its electrostrictive properties such that it can become airtight and insulatory when exposed to harsh conditions.

Dress like a cruiser captain, a hotshot pilot, or space station lab staff, and rest assured in the knowledge that hypermesh suits DO NOT become malodorous with continuous wear, unlike previous-generation synthread jumpsuits.
Why cram yourself into tens of kilograms of plasteel when lightweight hypermesh can deliver similar* performance**?
Now that's Functional Future Fashion™!
